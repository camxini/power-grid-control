**Phase 1:** 2025 MCM, ZJU Problem A

9 May, 2025 to 19 May, 2025 by YANG, YUAN, LI

An algorithm to calculate loss-load and over-load risks and probabilities of a distributed power grid when many errors exist.

However, it is proved infeasible because I thought the users are connected to the grid in series, not in parallel.

We solved this fault and go to phase 2.
